# Secure Cables Communication

Secure and anonymous communication using email-like addresses, pioneered in [Liberté Linux](http://dee.su/liberte).
Cables communication is Liberté's pivotal component for enabling anyone to communicate safely and covertly in [hostile environments](http://dee.su/liberte-motivation).

See the [project site](http://dee.su/cables) for further details, and read the [Wiki](https://github.com/mkdesu/cables/wiki) for implementation and [deployment](https://github.com/mkdesu/cables/wiki/deployment) details.
